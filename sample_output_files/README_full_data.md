## Usage Instructions

The weather dashboard enables users to view the weather outlook for any given city. Users have the option of searching for a city and the application then loads up the current and future weather conditions for that city.\n The application also maintains a history of the cities that were loaded up by the search.

To manually test the application, the below scenarios can be used:<br>1) If the search city is not entered when the user clicks the search button,a validation message is displayed to the user.<br>2) Once the weather information is loaded for a city, it is added to the search history. The search history is maintained for the last 10 successful searches.<br>3) If the user clicks on a city from the search history, the application loads up the weather details for that city.<br>4) If the application is closed and re-opened, the weather details of the last searched city is loaded up by default.<br>5) The 5-day weather forecast displays the weather conditions for the next 5 days for the given city based on midday values.

## FAQ

Can I access this application via a smaller devices like a phone ?<br>This application is built using Responsive web design principles. Responsive web design provides better accessibility and an optimal viewing experience to the user, by ensuring that web pages render well on different devices and window / screen sizes. To achieve this, I have used the Bootstrap front-end component library to build my pages.
